# Thread Safe Malloc Library Function Implementation

- Implemented the library function malloc() and free() that are in C standard library with free list data structure based on linked list.
- Improved the space utilization in the heap area by supporting splitting and/or merging a chunk of heap memory.
- Increased the efficiency and speed by realizing the thread-safe property using synchronization primitives and thread local storage strategy.
